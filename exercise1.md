CI Setup for a Python Project

For a Python project, setting up CI involves a few key things. First, you’ll need a linter like flake8 or pylint to catch coding mistakes and enforce style rules. Then, for testing, pytest is usually the best option. It’s simple and flexible, and it does not really care about the size of the software. For packaging, you’d use something like setuptools or poetry to bundle your app.

Other CI Options

If you haven't used Jenkins or GitHub Actions, you could try GitLab CI if you’re more familiar with GitLab already. CircleCI is also solid, especially if you’re working with Docker. You could also go with Travis CI, but it is already a bit oldish and not so widely used anymore

Self-Hosted vs. Cloud-Based CI

Choosing between self-hosted and cloud-based CI depends on your situation. Self-hosting gives you more control but requires more maintenance. Cloud-based options like GitHub Actions are easier to set up and scale, but they might get expensive if you’re using them a lot.

So, it really comes down to what fits best with your team and your project.
